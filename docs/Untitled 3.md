You don’t want to go into IT. That's the thesis I'm putting forward.  
  
And the first question that needs to be answered so that I can argue my point - What is this IT of yours?
  
Well. let's say. the first thing that comes to mind is IT is code.  
  
“Yeah! I am! I'm going to be the greatest programmers! I'll work at Google/Yandex/Vkontakte.”

or there's a bunch of other big companies to choose from. What do they all have going on over there?  
  
You start to get into all this stuff, you learn more and more. And their code is this tank of-- a cauldron of shi--. toxic waste! The code was once beautiful for its time and its small complexity
  
But now this tank is filled  

And they grab you by the scruff of the neck.

You're doing flip in the air.

And you go straight into that tank to dig through legacy outdated rotten code.  

OK. Ok. Slow down. What about smaller companies? They've got their own application requirements, same toxins... uhm... different color! So you're sure to be, ahem, headfirst into it.

All right, let's drop it. Let's say you get through this somehow, find a company you like.
  
But to get to this point you need to study the programming base: recursion, call stack, stack and heap in principle, standard data types, arrays, regular expressions, exceptions, input/output, abstract data types, objects, classes, polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, pointers.

The letters blur, everything fades and all you see is: Let's go drink beer, ACHEM-

I mean, "Let's learn JavaScript"

JavaScript is the easiest thing in the world, right?
  
Ha! There's at least half of the above, and then there's learning frameworks, working with browser modules...  
  
Oh no, back to the question. What is IT?

It's not just code, it's also design
  
It's also databases.

In IT, apart from coder-specific problems, there are also general ones.  
  
For example  
  
“Can I make an edit?” “And the color is lighter” "You don't have information about the user's zodiac sign in the database!" and a million other edits. Yeah, try to convince the customer that he's wrong.

In IT you often have to solve non-standard tasks, be ready for constant changes and updates.

It's an unpredictable adventure where you have to constantly learn new things
  
keep up with technology trends  
  
you're exposed to the unknown. 
  
Not everyone is ready to face it head-on.  
  
Do you REALLY want to go into IT?  
  
As a conclusion from all this presentation I can say one thing:  
  
Next please!
